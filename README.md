# CleanCode

The project is a Java application considered that simulates a battle game between two types of humans: craftsman and
warrior. The project originally violated several OOP principles and SOLID principles. To improve the design, the
Abstract Factory design pattern applied to create factories for creating human craftsman and warrior objects, and
original classes refactored to implement these factories. interfaces introduced to increase abstraction and dependency
inversion Finally, code refactored to improve naming, readability, and maintainability, and example Javadoc comment
added to improve documentation for Weapon interface. Overall, the refactored code is more modular, flexible, and easier
to extend.
